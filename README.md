This assignment leverages SQL and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Tables are created to hold the data from six (6) CSV. These are then imported into a SQL data base in order to perform data engineering and data analysis. 

 [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com) was used to sketch out an ERD of tables. 

</br>
The table schemas ran without error, and the ERD included the correct tables. </br>
</br>
Data Engineering: </br>
SQL code was applied that displayed:
<li>All required columns</li>
<li>Columns set to correct data type</li>
<li>Primary Keys established for each table</li>
<li>Tables correctly related using Foreign Keys </li> 

</br>

Data Analysis:</br>
The queries answered all the proposed questions. Additionally, all queries rendered the expect results. As the code was deployed successfully, all queries ran without error.
